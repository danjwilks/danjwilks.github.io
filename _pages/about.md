I am software engineer at Slack, with previous roles at WhatsApp/Facebook (Meta) and Menlo Security. Originally from London, UK, I now call Vancouver home. I studied computer science at the University of Edinburgh in the school of Informatics.

Beyond software development, I'm passionate about skiing, indoor bouldering, hiking, and football. I've also had the privilege of playing football with Brentford FC and Cardiff FC development squads.
